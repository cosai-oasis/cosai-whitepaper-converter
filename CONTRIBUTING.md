## Submitting a new issue

If you want to create a new issue that doesn't exist already, just open a new one.

## Signing the eCLA/iCLA

Anyone can do a pull request and commit. In order for your work to be merged, you will need to sign the iCLA (individual contributor agreement) if you are just contributing for yourself. If you are contributing on behalf of your company, you will also need to to sign the eCLA (entity contributor agreement). [Learn more about the CLAs here](https://www.oasis-open.org/open-projects/cla/).

The iCLA is administered by a bot which will comment on your PR and direct you to sign the iCLA if you haven't previously done so. This happens automatically when people submit a pull request.
